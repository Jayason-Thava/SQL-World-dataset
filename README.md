# 🌍 SQL Practice Project – World Database

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a hands-on SQL practice exercise using the **World dataset**.  
The goal was to strengthen SQL skills by writing queries, exploring relational database concepts, and applying core SQL keywords to extract meaningful insights.

The dataset contains information about **countries, cities, populations, languages, and economic indicators**, making it ideal for practicing relational queries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice writing SQL queries with **real-world relational data**.
- Use filtering, aggregation, and sorting to extract insights.
- Explore relationships between tables using **INNER JOIN**.
- Apply grouping and ordering to summarize results.
- Calculate derived metrics such as **population density** and **GDP per capita**.

| `WHERE`, `IN`, `LIKE`   | Filter rows based on conditions, patterns, or list inclusion                |
| `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`   | Aggregate data to calculate totals and metrics                              |
| `INNER JOIN`            | Combine rows from related tables based on matching keys                     |
| `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  | Group data for aggregation and sort results by one or more columns          |
| `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`       | Restrict the number of rows returned and paginate results                   |
| Aliases (`AS`)          | Rename columns or calculated fields for readability                         |
